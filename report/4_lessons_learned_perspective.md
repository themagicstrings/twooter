# Lessons Learned Perspective
<!--
Describe the biggest issues, how you solved them, and which are major lessons learned with regards to:
  - evolution and refactoring 
  - operation, and
  - maintenance
of your _ITU-MiniTwit_ systems. Link back to respective commit messages, issues, tickets, etc. to illustrate these.
Also reflect and describe what was the "DevOps" style of your work. For example, what did you do differently to previous development projects and how did it work?
