# Process' perspective
<!--
A description and illustration of:
  - How do you interact as developers?
  - How is the team organized?
  - A complete description of stages and tools included in the CI/CD chains.
    -  That is, including deployment and release of your systems.
  - Organization of your repositor(ies).
    - That is, either the structure of of mono-repository or organization of artifacts across repositories.
    - In essence, it has to be be clear what is stored where and why.
  - Applied branching strategy.
  - Applied development process and tools supporting it
    - For example, how did you use issues, Kanban boards, etc. to organize open tasks
  - How do you monitor your systems and what precisely do you monitor?
  - What do you log in your systems and how do you aggregate logs?
  - Brief results of the security assessment.
  - Applied strategy for scaling and load balancing.
In essence it has to be clear how code or other artifacts come from idea into the running system and everything that happens on the way.
