# System's Perspective

<!--
A description and illustration of the:
  - Design of your _ITU-MiniTwit_ systems
  - Architecture of your _ITU-MiniTwit_ systems
  - All dependencies of your _ITU-MiniTwit_ systems on all levels of abstraction and development stages.
    - That is, list and briefly describe all technologies and tools you applied and depend on.
  - Important interactions of subsystems
  - Describe the current state of your systems, for example using results of static analysis and quality assessment systems.
  - Finally, describe briefly, if the license that you have chosen for your project is actually compatible with the licenses of all your direct dependencies.
Double check that for all the weekly tasks (those listed in the schedule) you include the corresponding information.
