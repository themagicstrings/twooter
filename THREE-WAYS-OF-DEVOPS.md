# Three ways characterizing DevOps

# Flow
We often use pair-programming when we work, to get input from multiple people when making something. We use pull requests that need reviews to merge, such that multiple people check out code, even if only one person worked on it. A problem is that, we work in chunks, so we could be better to spread out the workflow, and maybe work more in parallel that way.

# Feedback
Our solution has some tests that are automatically run before merging pull requests. However, there are quite few of these, and not a lot of the code is covered by the tests. More should be added, and we should be more test-driven in our development.

# Continual Learning and Experimentation
We frequently take time to learn when developing. This can include for example to write a script to do something, instead of doing it manually. As the main purpose of this course is to learn, we consider it a top priority. However, keeping this enthusiasm for learning in other projects that are more focused on the end goal, will be challending
